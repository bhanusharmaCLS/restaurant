  # Example of regular route:

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  resources :items
  resources :book_tables

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do

  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
